# Coffee Place Assignments

# Ex 1. Add Milk
Good software is easily extensible.  Add Milk for $4.00 to the drinks menu. See how easy that was?  :-)

# Ex 2. Build Food Section
Build the food section to contain at least three food items.  This can resemble the drinks section or you can create your own approach.  Make sure the sidebar contains food items selected from the user.

# Ex 3. Build Dessert Section
Build the dessert section to contain at least three desserts.  This can resemble the drinks section or you can create your own approach.  Make sure the sidebar contains dessert items selected from the user.

# Ex 4. Center Title
Currently, the Coffee Place title is right justified.  Make this title center justified.

# Ex 5. Add Tax
Add 10% sales tax to the total order.

# Ex 6. Band Schedule
Indicate to users future performances of the band (band name & time).

# Ex 7. Connect to Web API
Currently, the business logic is stored on the client.  This is not ideal.  Move ALL business logic to calculate orders and taxes to a server side web API.
